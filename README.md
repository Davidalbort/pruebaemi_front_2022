* The design was changed, taking into account mobile first, since it was not included in the document, this proposal was taken into account in order not to use mediaQueri. 
* The logic of the challenge was proposed but could not be implemented, due to the short time to solve the challenge. As we know this challenge in agile development methodologies would take two springs of two to three weeks, therefore, only the theme of the layout was developed as a kind of MVP and the answers from SEO.
